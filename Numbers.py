# In python we have three types of numbers:
# Whole number
# float num
# complex num
x = 1
y = 1.1
# In complex number (j) represents the imaginary number
z = 1 + 2j

# Operations
print(10 + 2)
print(10 - 2)
print(10 * 2)
print(10 / 2)
print(10 // 2)  # If the answer comes in float, it'll be conv. to whole num
print(10 ** 2)  # Exponent
